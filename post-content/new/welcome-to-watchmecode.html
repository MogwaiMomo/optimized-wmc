<span class="underline"><h2>Watch Me Code will completely change how you think about JavaScript.</h2></span>

<blockquote>“After watching a couple of Derick's videos, he addressed pretty much the exact problem I was facing, and said ‘well, this is the way you can solve this with just a small snippet of code.’ That pretty much changed the entire way I thought about my application.”</blockquote>
